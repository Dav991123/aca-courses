            <h3>Understanding event flow</h3>
            <p>JavaScript’s interaction with HTML is handled through events, which indicate when particular moments of interest occur in the document or browser window. Events can be subscribed to using listeners (also called handlers) that execute only when an event occurs. This model, called the observer pattern</p>

            <h3>Event Bubbling</h3>
            <p>When you click the < div> element in the page, the click event occurs in the following order</p>
            <ul>
                <li>< div></li>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Event Bubbling</h3>
            <p>The click event is first fired on the < div> , which is the element that was clicked. Then the click event goes up the DOM tree, firing on each node along its way until it reaches the document object</p>

            <h3>Event Capturing</h3>
            <p> The theory of event capturing is that the least specific node should receive the event first and the most specific node should receive the event last. Event capturing was really designed to intercept the event before it reached the intended target.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>document</li>
                <li>< html></li>

                <li>< div></li>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Event Capturing</h3>
            <p>With event capturing, the click event is first received by the document and then continues down the DOM tree to the actual target of the event, the < div> element. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Flow</h3>
            <p>Event capturing occurs fi rst, providing the opportunity to intercept events if necessary. Next, the actual target receives the event. The final phase is bubbling, which allows a final response to the event.</p>
            <img src="images/event_flow.png" class='img w800' />
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Flow</h3>
            <p>In the DOM event flow, the actual target (the < div> element) does not receive the event during the capturing phase. This means that the capturing phase moves from document to < html> to < body> and stops</p>
            <p>Internet Explorer 9, Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari all support the DOM event flow; Internet Explorer 8 and earlier do not.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>EVENT HANDLERS</h3>
            <p>Events are certain actions performed either by the user or by the browser itself. These events have names like click , load , and mouseover . A function that is called in response to an event is called an event handler (or an event listener). Event handlers have names beginning with “on” , so an event handler for the click event is called onclick and an event handler for the load event is called onload .</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTML Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>Each event supported by a particular element can be assigned using an HTML attribute with the name of the event handler. The value of the attribute should be some JavaScript code to execute.When this button is clicked, an alert is displayed. This interaction is defi ned by specifying the onclick attribute and assigning some JavaScript code as the value. Note that since the JavaScript code is an attribute value, you cannot use HTML syntax characters such as the ampersand, double quotes, less-than, or greater-than without escaping them.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    < input type=”button” value=”Click Me” onclick=”alert(‘Clicked’)” />
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTML Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>An event handler defi ned in HTML may contain the precise action to take or it can call a script defined elsewhere on the page</p>
            <p>Code executing as an event handler has access to everything in the global scope.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    < script type=”text/javascript”>
                        function showMessage(){
                            alert(“Hello world!”);
                        }
                    < /script>
                    < input type=”button” value=”Click Me” onclick=”showMessage()” />
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTML Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>Event handlers assigned in this way have some unique aspects. First, a function is created that wraps the attribute value. That function has a special local variable called event , which is the event object</p>
            <p>This gives you access to the event object without needing to defi ne it yourself and without needing to pull it from the enclosing function’s argument list. The this value inside of the function is equivalent to the event’s target elemen</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    <!-- outputs “click” -->
                    < input type=”button” value=”Click Me” onclick=”alert(event.type)”>
                    <!-- outputs “Click Me” -->
                    < input type=”button” value=”Click Me” onclick=”alert(this.value)”>
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>The traditional way of assigning event handlers in JavaScript is to assign a function to an event handler property. This was the event handler assignment method introduced in the fourth generation of web browsers, and it still remains in all modern browsers because of its simplicity and cross-browser support.When assigning event handlers using the DOM Level 0 method, the event handler is considered to be a method of the element. The event handler, therefore, is run within the scope of element, meaning that this is equivalent to the element.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);
                    btn.onclick = function(){
                        alert(“Clicked”);
                        alert(this.id); //”myBtn”
                    };
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>The ID is retrieved using this.id . It’s possible to use this to access any of the element’s properties or methods from within the event handlers. Event handlers added in this way are intended for the bubbling phase of the event fl ow. You can remove an event handler assigned via the DOM Level 0 approach by setting the value of the event handler property to null</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    btn.onclick = null; //remove event handler
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>DOM Level 2 Events defi ne two methods to deal with the assignment and removal of event handlers: addEventListener() and removeEventListener() . These methods exist on all DOM nodes and accept three arguments: the event name to handle, the event handler function, and a Boolean value indicating whether to call the event handler during the capture phase ( true ) or during the bubble phase ( false ).</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                const btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);
                btn.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
                    alert(this.id);
                }, false);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>This code adds an onclick event handler to a button that will be fi red in the bubbling phase (since the last argument is false ). As with the DOM Level 0 approach, the event handler runs in the scope of the element on which it is attached. The major advantage to using the DOM Level 2 method for adding event handlers is that multiple event handlers can be added.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                const btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);
                btn.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
                    alert(this.id);
                }, false);
                btn.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
                    alert(“Hello world!”);
                }, false);
                </code>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>Event handlers added via addEventListener() can be removed only by using removeEventListener() and passing in the same arguments as were used when the handler was added. This means that anonymous functions added using addEventListener() cannot be removed</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                const btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);

                btn.removeEventListener(“click”, function(){
                    alert(this.id); //won’t work!

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>DOM Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>The call to removeEventListener() looks like it’s using the same arguments, but in reality, the second argument is a completely different function than the one used in addEventListener() . The event handler function passed into removeEventListener() must be the same one that was used in addEventListener()</p>
            <pre>
                <code>

            <h3>Internet Explorer Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>Internet Explorer implements methods similar to the DOM called attachEvent() and detachEvent() . These methods accept the same two arguments: the event handler name and the event handler function. Since Internet Explorer 8 and earlier support only event bubbling, event handlers added using attachEvent() are attached on the bubbling phase. When using DOM Level 0, the event handler runs with a this value equal to the element on which it is attached; when using attachEvent() , the event handler runs in the global context, so this is equivalent to window</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                const btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);

            <p>The stopPropagation() method stops the fl ow of an event through the DOM structure immediately, canceling any further event capturing or bubbling before it occurs. For example, an event handler added directly to a button can call stopPropagation() to prevent an event handler on document.body from being fi red</p>

                <li>Wheel events are fired when a mouse wheel (or similar device) is used.</li>
                <li>Text events are fi red when text is input into the document.</li>

            <h3>UI Events</h3>
            <p>UI events are those events that aren’t necessarily related to user actions. These events existed in some form or another prior to the DOM specifi cation and were retained for backwards compatibility</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DOMActivate — Fires when an element has been activated by some user action, by either mouse or keyboard (more generic than click or keydown ).</li>
                <li>load — Fires on a window when the page has been completely loaded, on a frameset when all frames have been completely loaded, on an < img> element</li>
                <li>unload — Fires on a window when the page has been completely unloaded, on a frameset when all frames have been completely unloaded</li>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Focus Events</h3>
            <p>Focus events are fi red when elements of a page receive or lose focus. These events work in concert with the document.hasFocus() and document.activeElement properties to give insight as to how the user is navigating the page</p>
            <ul>
                <li>blur — Fires when an element has lost focus</li>
                <li>DOMFocusIn — Fires when an element has received focus.</li>
                <li>DOMFocusOut — Fires when an element has lost focus. This is a generic version of the blur HTML event.</li>

            <h3>Mouse and Wheel Events</h3>
            <p>Mouse events are the most commonly used group of events on the Web, because the mouse is the primary navigation device used</p>
            <ul>
                <li>click — Fires when the user clicks the primary mouse button or when the user presses the Enter key.</li>
                <li>dblclick — Fires when the user double-clicks the primary mouse button</li>
                <li>mousedown — Fires when the user pushes any mouse button down.</li>
                <li>mouseenter — Fires when the mouse cursor is outside of an element and then the user first moves it inside of the boundaries of the element.</li>
                <li>mouseleave — Fires when the mouse cursor is over an element</li>

            <h3>Client Coordinates</h3>
            <p>Mouse events all occur at a particular location within the browser viewport. This information is stored in the clientX and clientY properties of the event object.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                const div = document.getElementById(“myDiv”);

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Page Coordinates</h3>
            <p>Where client coordinates give you information about where an event occurred in the viewport, page coordinates tell you where on the page the event occurred via the pageX and pageY properties of the event object. These properties indicate the location of the mouse cursor on the page, so the coordinates are from the left and top of the page itself rather than the viewport</p>
            <pre>

            <h3>Screen Coordinates</h3>
            <p>Mouse events occur not only in relation to the browser window but also in relation to the entire screen. It’s possible to determine the location of the mouse in relation to the entire screen by using the screenX and screenY properties.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>

            <h3>Keyboard and Text Events</h3>
            <p>Keyboard events are fi red when the user interacts with the keyboard. DOM Level 2 Events originally specified keyboard events, but that section was removed before the specification became fi nal. As a result, keyboard events are largely supported based on the original DOM Level 0 implementations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>keydown — Fires when the user presses a key on the keyboard and fires repeatedly while the key is being held down.</li>
                <li>keypress — Fires when the user presses a key on the keyboard that results in a character and fires repeatedly while the key is being held down. This event also fires for the Esc key.</li>
                <li>keyup — Fires when the user releases a key on the keyboard.</li>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Key Codes</h3>
            <p>For keydown and keyup events, the event object’s keyCode property is fi lled in with a code that maps to a specifi c key on the keyboard. For alphanumeric keys, the keyCode is the same as the ASCII value for the lowercase letter or number on that key, so the 7 key has a keyCode of 55 and the A key has a keyCode of 65, regardless of the state of the Shift key</p>
