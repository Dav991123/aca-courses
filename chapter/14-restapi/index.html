            <h3>What is an API? (Application Programming Interface)</h3>
            <p>API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API.</p>

            <h1>What Is an Example of an API?</h1>
            <p>When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h1>Types of APIs</h1>
            <p>APIs come in many forms. API designers can choose from a range of protocols and standards when creating a new API, depending on the type of API they are creating, and its purpose .</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web APIs</li>
                <li>Open APIs</li>
                <li>Internal APIs</li>
                <li>Partner APIs</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Web API</h3>
            <p>Web APIs are APIs that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol. The API defines endpoints, and valid request and response formats. Web APIs include the APIs used to communicate with the browser. They may be services such as web notifications and web storage. Different web APIs feature varying levels of security and privacy, including open, internal and partner APIs. Multiple web APIs can be combined into a composite API - a collection of data or service APIs.   </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Open API</h3>
            <p>Open APIs, also known as external or public APIs, are available to developers and other users with minimal restrictions. They may require registration, and use of an API key, or may be completely open. They are intended for external users (developers at other companies, for example) to access data or services . Any developer can access it, without even registering, allowing app builders to include governmental data on restaurant standards in their apps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Internal API</h3>
            <p>In contrast to open APIs, internal APIs are designed to be hidden from external users. They are used within a company to share resources. They allow different teams or sections of a business to consume each other’s tools, data and programs. Using internal APIs has several advantages over conventional integration techniques, including security and access control, an audit trail of system access, and a standard interface for connecting multiple services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Partner API</h3>
            <p>Partner APIs are technically similar to open APIs, but they feature restricted access, often controlled through a third-party API gateway. They are usually intended for a specific purpose, such as providing access to a paid-for service. This is a very common pattern in software as a service ecosystem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>What is a REST API</h3>
            <p>A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.</p>
            <p>
                When working with APIs you may come across the term REST or RESTful. <b>REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  REST is a set of recommendations that an API can adhere to.</b> This makes designing the API easier and using the API more predictable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>REST API</h3>
            <p>REST's approach to guidelines allows APIs to be more <b>modular and layered.</b> </p>
            <p>REST is optimized for the common case so that the constraints it applies to the Web architecture will also be optimized for the common case.</p>
            <p>Developers can add the functionality they need, while still providing some uniformity. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>REST API</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Client-server:</b> The client and server act independently. There is a clear separation of concerns, and requests and responses are exchanged to communicate.</li>
                <li><b>Stateless:</b> Each request is self-contained in that it includes any information needed for the server to understand the request. The client can hold session state, but the server doesn't store any context.</li>
                <li><b>Cache:</b> Designed to encourage caching, REST expects responses to be labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. This allows clients to reuse responses for future requests if needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>REST API</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Uniform Interface:</b> The core distinguishing feature of REST is its interface. Regardless of where a resource (data) comes from, it is accessible via a predictable and consistent interface.</li>
                <li><b>Layered System:</b> Where SOAP was very much "all-in", REST allows for a more modular, layered approach to building an API. For example, <b>the API entry points can be decoupled from the auth server and the data sources as needed.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>How it all works</h3>
            <p>With some foundational knowledge out of the way, let's look at how clients and servers use REST to interact. A REST API exposes endpoints. These are unique endpoints that build upon a core, base path</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    // A base path may look like:
                    https://api.example.com
                    // Endpoints may then look like:
                    /users
                    /user
                    /organizations/:id/teams
                    /profile
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Endpoints</h3>
            <p>Endpoints can be defined with fixed values, like /users above, or through more dynamic paths like /users/:id where :id is replaced with a specific user ID. Additionally, endpoints can accept query strings made up of properties and values that act as instructions for the endpoint. For example: /users?limit=10&order=ascending may request a list of 10 users in ascending order. Combined, a full resource path ends up looking something like:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
            https://api.example.com/users?limit=10&order=ascending
                    ^^Base Path     ^^ Endpoint ^^Query String
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>REST API Data formats</h3>
            <p>Data formats the REST API supports include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>application/json</li>
                <li>application/xml</li>
                <li>application/x-wbe+xml</li>
                <li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li>
                <li>multipart/form-data</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTTP Methods</h3>
            These endpoints are then combined with a set of HTTP request methods to define the action they can take. These line up with the Create, Read, Update, and Delete verbs of "CRUD" applications. The core HTTP methods that endpoints focus on are:
            <ul>
                <li>GET: Retrieve/Read data.</li>
                <li>POST: Create new data.</li>
                <li>PUT/PATCH: Update data.</li>
                <li>DELETE: Delete existing data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTTP Methods, HTTP status</h3>
            <p>GET and DELETE can interact with the endpoint itself, but POST and PUT/PATCH are capable of sending data in the body of the request. This is often as stringified JSON or Form data. All requests can, and often, contain a set of headers such as Authorization, Content-Type, and more that act to describe the request.</p>
            <p>API server processes the request, performs the required action, and sends a response back. This response is normally in the form of an HTTP status code and a JSON object.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTTP headers</h3>
            <p>HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTTP headers</h3>
            <p>Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request headers contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.</li>
                <li>Response headers hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.</li>
                <li>Representation headers contain information about the body of the resource, like its MIME type, or encoding/compression applied.</li>
                <li>Payload headers contain representation-independent information about payload data, including content length and the encoding used for transport</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTTP headers: Authentication</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>WWW-Authenticate
                Defines the authentication method that should be used to access a resource.</li>
                <li>Authorization Contains the credentials to authenticate a user-agent with a server.</li>
                <li>Proxy-Authenticate Defines the authentication method that should be used to access a resource behind a proxy server</li>
                <li>Proxy-Authorization Contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a proxy server.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Authentication Example</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access to the staging site", charset="UTF-8"

                    Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
                    
                    Proxy-Authenticate: Basic

        </div>
        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>Caching</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Age The time, in seconds, that the object has been in a proxy cache.</li>
                <li>Cache-Control Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.</li>
                <li>Clear-Site-Data Clears browsing data (e.g. cookies, storage, cache) associated with the requesting website.</li>
                <li>Expires The date/time after which the response is considered stale.</li>
                <li>Pragma Implementation-specific header that may have various effects anywhere along the request-response chain. Used for backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches where the Cache-Control header is not yet present.</li>
                <li>Warning General warning information about possible problems.</li>

            <h3>OpenAPI Swagger</h3>
            <p>The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
            </p>
            <p>An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.</p>

            <h3>What is SOAP</h3>
            <p>SOAP or Simple Objects Access Protocol is a web communication protocol designed for Microsoft back in 1998. Today, it’s mostly used to expose web services and transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS. But it’s not limited to them. SOAP, unlike the REST pattern, supports the XML data format only and strongly follows preset standards such as messaging structure, a set of encoding rules, and a convention for providing procedure requests and responses.</p>
            <p>The built-in functionality to create web-based services allows SOAP to handle communications and make responses language- and platform-independent.</p>

            <h3>SOAP works with XML only</h3>
            <p>Web-transmitted data is usually structured in some way. The two most popular data formats are XML and JSON.</p>
            <p>XML (or Extensible Markup Language) is a text format that establishes a set of rules to structure messages as both human- and machine-readable records. But XML is verbose as it aims at creating a web document with all its formality. JSON, on the other hand, has a loose structure that focuses on the data itself</p>

            <h3>SOAP Transfer protocols: HTTP, TCP, SMTP, FTP</h3>
            <p>SOAP supports a variety of transfer protocols, both high- and low-level ones. For instance, SOAP allows for messaging via TCP (Transaction Control Protocol), a low-level data exchange method that works between ports via an IP network. You can go for the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) option, which is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and any other transfer method that supports text data exchange.</p>

            <h3>SOAP vs REST</h3>
            <p>SOAP provides the following advantages when compared to REST:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP) </li>
                <li>Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)</li>
                <li>Standardized</li>
                <li>Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards</li>
                <li>Built-in error handling</li>
                <li>Automation when used with certain language products</li>

            <h3>SOAP vs REST</h3>
            <p>REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages when compared to SOAP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses easy to understand standards like swagger and OpenAPI Specification 3.0</li>
                <li>Smaller learning curve</li>
                <li>Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST mostly uses smaller message formats like JSON)</li>
                <li>Fast (no extensive processing required)</li>
                <li>Closer to other Web technologies in design philosophy</li>

            <h3>What is GraphQL</h3>
            <p>GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.</p>
            <p>GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. It can even be deployed within an integrated development environment (IDE) known as GraphiQL. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call. </p>

            <h3>What is web socket </h3>
            <p>HTTP and WebSocket both are communication protocols used in client-server communication.</p>
            <p>HTTP protocol: HTTP is unidirectional where the client sends the request and the server sends the response. Let’s take an example when a user sends a request to the server this request goes in the form of HTTP or HTTPS, after receiving a request server send the response to the client, each request is associated with a corresponding response, after sending the response the connection gets closed, each HTTP or HTTPS request establish the new connection to the server every time and after getting the response the connection gets terminated by itself.</p>

            <h3>WebSocket</h3>
            <p>WebSocket: WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). after closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both the end</p>

            <h3>HTML Web Storage API</h3>
            <p>With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.
            Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
            Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.
            Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.</p>

        <div class="step slide">
            <h3>HTML Web Storage Objects</h3>
            <p>HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:</p>

                <li>window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date</li>
                <li>window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed</li>

            <h3>The localStorage Object</h3>
            <p>The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>

            <p>Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
            When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
            Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":</p>
            <p>When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.</p>
