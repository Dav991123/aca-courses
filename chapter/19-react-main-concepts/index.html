               <h2>JavaScript Frameworks Vs Libraries—What’s The Difference?</h2>
               <p>
                While the terms Library and Framework may sound similar, they both work differently.
                Many people use these two words interchangeably without knowing the profound meaning behind them.
                Before we dig into the key differences between Library and Framework, let's look at the common purpose that they both serve.
                Both Library and Framework are code written by some developer to solve a complicated problem efficiently.
                They both give you an excellent approach to write DRY (don't repeat yourself) code.
                Their purpose was to increase the reusability of the code so that you can use the same piece of code or functions again in your various project.

           <h2>What is Library?</h2>
           <p>
           <hr>
                A Library is a set of code that was previously written by a developer
                that you can call when you are building your project.
                In Library, you import or call specific methods that you need for your project.
                In simple words, a bunch of code packed together that can be used repeatedly is known as Library.
                Reusability is one of the main reasons to use libraries.
            </p>
            <h3>Examples of JavaScript Libraries:</h3>
           <ul>
                <li>
                    jQuery
                    <img src="" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    React JS
                </li>
                <li>
                    Redux
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lodash

            <h2>What is Framework?</h2>
            <p>
                <hr>
                A framework is a supporting structure that gives shape to your code.
                In the Framework, you have to fill the structure accordingly with your code.
                There is a specific structure for a particular framework that you have to follow, 
                and it's generally more restrictive than Library. One thing to remember here is 
                that frameworks sometimes get quite large, so they may also use the Library.But the 
                Framework doesn't necessarily have to use Library.
            </p>
            <h3>Some common examples of Framework are:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Angular</li>
                <li>Ember JS</li>

            <h2>Real DOM</h2>
            <p>
                DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most 
                JavaScript operations. This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM 
                much more than they have to. As an example, let’s say that you have a list that contains ten items. You check off the 
                first item. Most JavaScript frameworks would rebuild the entire list. That’s ten times more work than necessary! 
                Only one item changed, but the remaining nine get rebuilt exactly how they were before.
                Rebuilding a list is no big deal to a web browser, but modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation. 
                Inefficient updating has become a serious problem.To address this problem, the people at React popularized something 
                called the virtual DOM.

            <h2>The Virtual DOM</h2>
            <p>
                In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a 
                representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy. A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, 
                but it lacks the real thing’s power to directly change what’s on the screen. Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the 
                virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell 
                React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state.

            <h2>Reconciliation Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                React provides a declarative API so that you don’t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update. 
                This makes writing applications a lot easier, but it might not be obvious how this is implemented within React.

            <p>
                Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate markup or programming languages into JavaScript.
                With Babel, you can use the newest features of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015).
                Babel is available for different conversions. React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.

                an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
                The component also requires a <mark>render()</mark> method, this method returns HTML.

                Look in the myfirstreact directory, and you will find a src folder. 
                Inside the src folder there is a file called App.js, open it and it will look like this:

                Props are arguments passed into React components.
                Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
                React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
                To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:
                <b>Note: React Props are read-only! You will get an error if you try to change their value.</b>

            <h2>React State</h2>
            <p>
                React components has a built-in state object.
                The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
                When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
            </p>
            <b>Prior to React 16.8, we had to use class based components to use state. New we can use functional components with hooks</b>

            <p>
                State can be updated in response to event handlers, server responses, or prop changes. 
                This is done using the setState() method. The setState() method enqueues all of the updates 
                made to the component state and instructs React to re-render the component and its children
                with the updated state. Always use the setState() method to change the state object, since it will ensure that the 
                component knows it’s been updated and calls the render() method.

            <h2>Handling Events</h2>
            <p>
                Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events.
                React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
                Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. 
                You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, 
                you can write:
            </p>
            <img class='img w1000' src="./images/react-event.png" alt="">
            <br>

            <h2>Fragments</h2>
            <p>
                A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. 
                Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/react-fragment.png" alt="">
            <p>There is also a new short syntax for declaring them.</p>

            <h2>React Keys</h2>
            <p>
                A key is a unique identifier. In React, it is used to identify which items have changed, updated, 
                or deleted from the Lists. It is useful when we dynamically created components or when the users 
                alter the lists. It also helps to determine which components in a collection needs to be re-rendered 
                instead of re-rendering the entire set of components every time. Keys should be given inside the array 
                to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key as a string that uniquely identifies 
                the items in the list. It can be understood with the below example.

            <h2>React Component lifecycle</h2>
            <p>
                Each component goes through three phases: mounting, updating and unmounting. 
                You can also think of it as our natural life cycle: we are born, we grow (adolescence and adulthood),
                and eventually, we die. React components are created by being mounted onto the DOM, they change or grow through updates, 
                and finally, they can be removed or unmounted from the DOM. These three milestones are referred to as the React component lifecycle.
